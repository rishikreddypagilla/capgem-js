BLOCK SCOPE
the values which are declared in a function or condition which we can 
call as a bloc kcannot be used outside block 
for loop 
while 
functions 
these are some examples for block scope

------var is the only case it dosent have the block scope--------

// function expression
const num = function(n){
    return n*n
}
num(10)

a call back function is a function passed into another function as an argument
which is invoked inside another function

forEach()
it accepts the call back function. calls the callback 

map()
it is used to create a new array from an existing array by applying some logic


implicit return 
in scenearios where we want to return one expression as shown 
above we can rewrite this arrow function using parentheses instead of curly braces 
there we have to  

-------------------------------
// filter filter out the elements in the array which match the condition 
--------------------------------
// find gives us the first element which matches the condition 
-------------------------
every()
if every element need to check in the array with the condition (it returns boolean value )

some()
here any some of the array elements needs to satisfiy the condition 

sort()

slice() will create a copy of the array 
[....arr] will aslo create the copy of array 

reduce()
will take all the values and make it a singular value 

rest parameters(new)
rest parameters in javascript allow you to represent an indefinite number of 
arguments as an array inside a function
